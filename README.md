# Usage
You need to provide the canonical paths to your files/directories that you want to upload, each item seperated by a single comma. For example,


```bash
~/dummyfile.txt,~/Pictures/Wallpapers
```

If you put in multiple directories, they will all be inside a single zip archive. All files will be available in Dropbox as ``/home/Documents``.
